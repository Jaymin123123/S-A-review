APG Asset Management NV,"**APG Asset Management NV Voting Policy on Remuneration**

- **General Approach:** The remuneration policy for management board members should be clear, understandable, focus on long-term value creation, and consider internal pay ratios. It should not encourage self-interest or excessive risk-taking outside the company's strategy and risk appetite. The supervisory board is responsible for formulating and implementing the policy.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** Severance payments should not exceed one year’s fixed salary. Severance is not awarded if termination is at the management board member's initiative or due to serious culpable or negligent behavior. Variable remuneration must be linked to measurable performance criteria determined in advance and predominantly long-term.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** Shares awarded should be held for at least five years. Supervisory board members may not receive remuneration in the form of shares or rights to shares.

- **Performance Alignment:** Variable remuneration components must be linked to measurable performance criteria determined in advance, predominantly long-term. The remuneration report must describe how variable remuneration contributes to long-term value creation and detail the performance criteria used.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** Severance pay may not exceed fixed annual salary except in manifestly unreasonable termination in first term, where max is twice fixed salary. No guaranteed compensation for poor performance. Variable pay may not exceed 100% of fixed pay; above this is case-by-case.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** Variable long-term pay granted unconditionally over at least three years; in event of public offer/legal merger/spin-off, conditional shares awarded at most pro rata. No numeric dilution limits or repricing/strike price rules mentioned.

Variable pay must strengthen commitment and contain no guaranteed components. Variable components include ESG objectives that are clear, quantifiable, time-related, challenging, measurable, transparent, and performance-related.

- **Clawbacks:** Present; clawback of unconditional/paid variable pay if awarded based on incorrect information. Supervisory board institutes recovery procedures.

- **General Approach:** Boards are responsible for remuneration policies that promote long-term success and alignment with corporate objectives and business strategy. AXA IM supports remuneration policies aligned with sustainable value creation and ESG integration.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** Remuneration levels should be sufficient but not excessive, considering company, sector, and country conditions. Pay increases for senior executives should not exceed those for the general workforce. Termination benefits should not exceed 24 months compensation and should not reward failure.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** Share-based incentives should reward sustainable shareholder value creation, be subject to challenging and disclosed performance conditions, and have performance periods no shorter than three years. New share schemes require shareholder approval. Schemes should not lead to dilution of shareholder equity beyond acceptable limits. Stock options must not be priced below market or be repriced/backdated.

- **Performance Alignment:** Annual bonuses and LTIPs must be tied to defined, relevant, and challenging performance criteria aligned with company strategy, including ESG targets. ESG elements must be tangible, clearly explained, and integrated in both short- and long-term remuneration. Executives are encouraged to hold shares at least equivalent to one year’s salary.

- **Clawbacks:** Present. Boards should consider reclaiming rewards if performance achievements were significantly misstated warranting bonus or incentive payment clawback.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** Companies should include ESG elements in remuneration to motivate sustainable business models. For certain sectors sensitive to climate or social issues, specific ESG criteria are expected in variable pay. Non-financial performance criteria should be part of LTIPs.

- **Voting Considerations:**
  - Poor disclosure of remuneration policies or performance metrics may lead to withheld support.
  - Excessive pay, misaligned peer comparisons, or unjustified rewards relative to company performance are concerns.
  - Lack of ESG integration in remuneration or insufficiently stringent/clear KPIs is a negative factor.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** Uncapped bonus potential is not accepted; increases in base salary above inflation require a compelling rationale; severance pay exceeding one-time base salary or local market norms is not accepted; discretionary payments without clear rationale or performance criteria are not accepted; pay-for-failure warrants a vote against.

Alberta Investment Management Corp,"**Alberta Investment Management Corp Voting Policy on Remuneration**

- **General Approach:** Compensation for management and directors should be fully disclosed, reasonable to attract qualified candidates, and structured to provide incentives commensurate with performance. Compensation should align management’s and directors’ interests with shareholders’ interests. Boards and compensation committees are responsible for establishing compensation philosophy, setting, and assessing performance measures.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** Not mentioned.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** Equity-based compensation plans including stock option plans should link compensation to performance, encourage executives to own stock, and align interests with shareholders. Plans should have shareholder approval for amendments and proper disclosure of terms and award criteria. Vote against plans that are excessively dilutive, costly relative to performance and peers, have below-market option discounts, have option exercise prices higher than market value, have evergreen options, allow accelerated vesting on change of control, or lack disclosure. The potential dilution for employee stock purchase plans and all equity plans should be less than 10% of outstanding shares, with a term not exceeding 5 years. Vote for stock option repricing when shareholders approve and for performance-based equity compensation plans.

- **Performance Alignment:** Performance criteria and results should be clearly disclosed. Say-on-pay emphasizes the alignment of pay with performance and balancing of stakeholder interests. Problematic pay practices include a disconnect between pay and performance, lack of long-term incentives that measure performance over an appropriate horizon, disproportionate CEO versus next executive pay, and failure to respond to shareholder say-on-pay votes.

- **Clawbacks:** Not mentioned.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** Not mentioned.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** Executive remuneration should not exceed what’s necessary to execute strategy and appropriately incentivise. There should be an appropriate balance between fixed and incentive pay with disclosed limits for incentives. One-off awards such as transaction bonuses are generally not supported.

Retesting or retrospective changes to performance conditions are not acceptable. Not mentioned are numeric dilution limits or rules on repricing/strike price.

- **Performance Alignment:** Performance metrics must be clearly disclosed, stretching, and aligned with strategy and business model. Remuneration committees should consider deferring part of annual bonuses in shares and encourage material share ownership by executives. Discretionary awards should be transparently justified and aligned with shareholder interests.

- **Clawbacks:** Present. Remuneration committees should have appropriate mechanisms such as clawback provisions and contractual arrangements to avoid inappropriate payments on early termination or preferential equity treatment on change of control.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** Encouraged where ESG factors materially impact performance. Metrics should be high quality, measurable, specific, aligned with strategy, and appropriately weighted. Companies in high climate impact sectors should link executive incentives with climate transition plans aligned with a 1.5°C net-zero goal. If no ESG factors are included, companies should explain why.

- **Voting Considerations:**
  - Excessive or unreasonable remuneration structures and quantum.
  - Lack of disclosure or transparency on remuneration, performance metrics, or use of discretion.
  - Absence of appropriate clawback provisions or poor alignment with long-term shareholder value.

Subscription price must align with market conditions, no discount or repricing allowed. Performance conditions and/or minimum holding periods are required. Total plan awards must remain below 10% of share capital except if exceptional and justified.

- **Performance Alignment:** Performance criteria must be quantifiable, consistent with company strategy, and include ESG KPIs.

Deferred payment of remuneration is expected, conditional on maintaining company performance.

- **Clawbacks:** Present implicitly—outstanding deferred remuneration will not be paid if serious questionable or illegal events occur, especially regarding risk-taking.

Use of relative performance measures, preferably against competitors, is encouraged. There should be a clear link between performance and remuneration; no remuneration without this link.

Aviva Investors Global Services Ltd,"**Aviva Investors Global Services Ltd Voting Policy on Remuneration**

- **General Approach:** Remuneration packages should be simple, balanced, transparent, and aligned with company strategy to incentivise and reward long-term sustainable value creation. Pay outcomes must reflect company performance and stakeholder experience.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** Companies should provide clear rationales for pay increases, normally below workforce increases unless justified. Salary increases post-acquisition should be performance-related. New director salaries should not exceed predecessors unless exceptional circumstances. Executive pension entitlements should mirror general workforce benefits. Discretionary and retention payments are not approved.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** LTIPs should have a minimum three-year performance period. Dilution of share awards from all schemes should not exceed 10% of issued ordinary share capital (or 5% for executive/discretionary schemes) in any rolling 10-year period. Retesting of performance conditions is not supported. Awards should be prorated on departure and upon change in control, with no automatic waiving of conditions. Share options and co-investment plans are supported if aligned with shareholder interests.

- **Performance Alignment:** Majority of pay should be performance-based with transparent, clearly defined, measurable performance conditions avoiding cliff-edge vesting. Bonuses at target should not exceed 50% of maximum payouts; long-term awards vesting at or below 25% for median performance. Performance measures should include ESG targets where material, including climate objectives for high carbon sectors, integrated into malus and clawback mechanisms or incorporated as an underpin. Total Shareholder Returns (TSR) is preferred as a performance measure.

- **Clawbacks:** Present. Pay arrangements should allow for performance adjustment or post-vesting clawback for executive directors’ variable pay with specified circumstances for action.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** ESG metrics must be robust, relevant, and meaningful to total pay outcomes when material, including climate-related objectives in variable pay for executives and senior management in high carbon-emitting sectors.

- **Voting Considerations:**
  - Pay misaligned with shareholder interests or wider workforce.
  - Excessive fixed or variable pay, significant increases, or discretionary/retention payments without explanation.
  - Failure to adjust pay after significant ESG incidents or failings.

BNP Paribas Asset Management France SAS,"**BNP Paribas Asset Management France SAS Voting Policy on Remuneration**

- **General Approach:** Executive compensation plans should align with long-term company performance, discourage irresponsible risk-taking, include non-financial targets related to sustainability, respect best market practices, be disclosed clearly, and be subject to shareholder approval.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** Base salary and its evolution must be justified and reasonable. Bonuses must be linked to transparent, pertinent, and challenging criteria, disclosed with performance weights and targets, and capped as a percentage of fixed remuneration. Any significant unjustified increase in base salary or bonus cap is opposed.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** Plans must have specific quantitative pre-established criteria, a vesting and performance period of at least five years, and disclose caps, criteria, weights, and targets. Limits include cumulative volume not exceeding 10% of issued capital (3% max for corporate officers), annual stock option grants not exceeding 2.5%, and free shares distribution not exceeding 1% of issued capital. Repricing, discounts for executives, re-testing of exercising conditions, or vesting/holding periods less than three years are opposed.

- **Performance Alignment:** Remuneration must be aligned with long-term company performance, integrating environmental and social criteria in variable components; performance criteria, weights, and fulfillment levels must be disclosed transparently. Absence of relevant ESG or climate-related criteria in remuneration is opposed.

- **Clawbacks:** Present. Companies should have clawback policies allowing partial or full recovery of past plans after special circumstances such as restatement of accounts.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** Companies are required to link executive variable compensation to relevant environmental and social performance criteria. Absence of such criteria within short or long-term remuneration components triggers opposition.

- **Voting Considerations:**
  - Transparency and clarity of remuneration disclosures including philosophy, amounts, splits, and evolution.
  - Independence of the remuneration committee (>50% independent members, excluding executive directors).
  - Reasonableness and market alignment of remuneration amounts and limits, including severance and exceptional pay.

**Blackrock, Inc Voting Policy on Remuneration**

- **General Approach:** Remuneration should reward, attract, and retain highly talented individuals fundamental to long-term durable value creation, with pay closely linked to performance and aligned with generating durable long-term shareholder value. Remuneration committees should have significant flexibility in administering remuneration arrangements consistent with company strategy.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** Severance payments should be limited to two years of fixed remuneration (plus bonus where expected) for forced departures of good leavers. Base salary increases should progress in line with the workforce unless strong rationale is provided. Pension contributions for executives should align with those of the workforce.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** 
  - Total volume of LTIPs should not exceed 10% of the capital, considering proposed and outstanding authorities.
  - Plans should have clear disclosure on grant limits, performance criteria, vesting periods, and overall dilution.
  - Awards should not vest immediately on change of control.
  - Retesting of performance criteria under LTIPs is discouraged.
  - Vesting periods should be multi-year, preferably minimum of three to five years.
  - Restricted schemes should reduce award value generally by at least 50% compared to variable pay.
  - Matching plans should be capped and linked to additional performance criteria.

- **Performance Alignment:** 
  - Majority of variable pay should be linked to relevant and challenging performance criteria aligned with strategic objectives.
  - Performance metrics should be multiple, majority financial, with at least 60% based on quantitative criteria.
  - Metrics should focus on factors within management’s control, including financial value creation; wary of sole use of output metrics like absolute TSR or EPS.
  - Sustainability-related criteria, if included, should be material, rigorous, and adequately disclosed.
  - Incentive plans should not encourage excessive risk-taking beyond the company’s risk appetite.
  - Disclosure should allow understanding of remuneration awarded at threshold, target, and maximum performance.
  - Plans should contain discretion for adjustments with disclosure on use and alignment.
  - Shareholding requirements for executives should be set and executives encouraged to retain shares post-departure, preferably for at least two years.
  - Pay should correlate with the company’s strategy and reflect long-term financial value creation.

- **Clawbacks:** Present. Remuneration committees should build malus and/or clawback provisions into incentive plans to allow forfeiture or repayment of awards where inappropriate, commonly triggered by gross misconduct or financial misstatement; companies should disclose triggers and enforcement measures.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** When sustainability-related criteria are used in compensation structures, metrics must be adequately disclosed, material to strategy, and as rigorous as financial or operational targets.

- **Voting Considerations:**
  - Assess linkage between pay and performance, clarity of remuneration framework, and transparent benchmarking with appropriate peer groups.
  - Oppose proposals where remuneration is excessive relative to peers without rationale, misaligned with performance, over-reliant on discretion or extraordinary pay, inadequately disclosed, or where there is lack of board responsiveness to investor concerns.
  - May oppose approval of remuneration or election of remuneration committee members for plans lacking performance targets, insufficient performance periods, inadequate disclosures, or excessive dilution.

- **In summary:** BlackRock votes to support remuneration structures that clearly align executive pay with long-term performance, risk management, and shareholder value, while opposing excessive, unclear, or poorly justified remuneration arrangements.

British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI),"**British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) Voting Policy on Remuneration**

It must align management interests with shareholders through long-term success and consider broader economic, workforce, and societal contexts.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** BCI is concerned with rapid increases in total executive pay not matched by workforce pay increases. Any salary increases should be in line with inflation barring exceptional circumstances, which must be explained.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** BCI prefers dilution limits of 5% but will evaluate plans up to 10% dilution if performance-based and meeting criteria. BCI will vote against plans with over 10% dilution unless unique circumstances exist. It votes against option repricing and option exchange programs. Plans with immediate vesting or options lifespan over five years are opposed. Concentration of awards over 20% in a single recipient is not supported.

- **Performance Alignment:** Plans must emphasize pay-for-performance linked to long-term shareholder value with predefined, relevant performance targets. Awards should not vest immediately and should include pro-rata vesting on change of control. BCI supports share retention policies to align executive and shareholder interests.

- **Clawbacks:** BCI supports and will vote for adopting clawback policies as sound risk mitigation measures within comprehensive compensation programs.

Excessive termination or change-in-control severance payments generally exceeding 3 times base salary and bonus are considered problematic. Votes also consider the rationale behind any significant remuneration increases and alignment with company performance.

Evaluate LTIPs case-by-case; oppose if performance hurdles are insufficient, repricing allowed without shareholder approval, or excessive dilution occurs.

- Plans should include change-in-control provisions (pro-rata vesting) and good leaver/bad leaver clauses.

- **Performance Alignment:**  
Require rigorous and transparent performance metrics with preference for relative TSR. No vesting for sub-median relative performance. Support sliding scale vesting over cliff vesting. Require disclosures enabling shareholders to assess pay-performance correlation. Significant emphasis on pay-for-performance evaluation over 3- and 5-year periods.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:**  
  - For executives, Comgest generally votes against stock option plans and amendments unless: it is a five-year plan with a minimum three-year vesting cycle and two-year lock-up; exercise price is not discounted (except Japanese deep-discount plans); maximum dilution does not exceed 3% of issued capital for mature companies and 5% for growth companies; and performance targets are challenging.  
  - Comgest favors allocation of free or discounted shares for employees if the plan covers the majority of employees and does not necessarily require performance hurdles.  
  - Comgest is generally opposed to stock options for non-executive board members.  
- **Performance Alignment:** Performance criteria must be clear, relevant, challenging, and aligned with company performance; remuneration should be linked to long-term strategic objectives.

Support equity plans that align management incentives with sustainable value creation. Opposition may occur if nondisclosed or excessive. No explicit numeric dilution limits stated.

- **Performance Alignment:** Pay must align with performance over a full business cycle. Long-term awards should vest within at least 3–5 years, with total vesting and holding periods of no less than 5 years.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** Salaries should be modest, focused on delivering value at least cost and set as tax efficient as possible. Short-term incentives play a role but must be disclosed with metrics. Guaranteed bonuses or compensation must be disclosed and justified if applicable. One-off awards are scrutinized case-by-case.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** Equity compensation should be the predominant form of pay, structured to maintain consistent timing and amounts to avoid over-incentivizing specific periods. Dilution must be clearly articulated with rationale, including intended life and run rates; simple peer comparisons are inadequate. Repricing requires explicit shareholder approval and is carefully considered. Use of employment agreements, severance, and perquisites must be well justified in context of alignment. Independent directors’ equity ownership requirements should be set and disclosed. Employee Stock Purchase Plans must have exercise/purchase prices no less than 85% of fair market value; loans are prohibited.

- **Performance Alignment:** Plans must be based on financial and qualitative metrics linked to sustainable long-term value aligned with company strategy. Use of adjusted performance metrics requires detailed rationale and reconciliation. Non-financial metrics should be disclosed with weights and measurement methodology. ESG metrics should be measurable and tied to material ESG risks or priorities.

- **Clawbacks:** Companies should adopt clawback policies that allow recoupment of incentive pay beyond legal minimums, including circumstances beyond intentional misconduct. Disclosure of recoupment instances is expected.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** ESG risks and opportunities must be incorporated into investment and corporate governance practices. Compensation metrics should incorporate material ESG factors linked to company risks or priorities. CalSTRS promotes sustainable practices as essential to long-term investment success.

- **Voting Considerations:**
  - Compensation committee members will generally receive votes against if pay plans or advisory votes fail to meet standards.
  - Shareholder approval is required for compensation plans, repricing, and annual advisory votes.
  - Hedging of equity awards by executives or directors is discouraged and policies should avoid it.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** Support voting on all equity-based compensation plans due to potential dilution. Will generally vote against plans if total cost is unreasonable, permits repricing without shareholder approval, allows excessive change of control payouts, or is not sufficiently performance-based. Prefer stock-based over option-based compensation for better alignment and predictability. Guideline opposes stock options for directors.

- **Performance Alignment:** Executive compensation should be linked to meaningful, disclosed performance targets relevant to long-term value creation, with a significant relationship between pay and performance. Equity-based compensation must have clearly disclosed performance criteria and hurdles.

Compensation packages should incentivize outcomes consistent with ESG considerations where appropriate.

- **Voting Considerations:**
  - Pay-for-performance alignment assessed against meaningful performance targets.
  - Independent and effective compensation committee involvement.
  - Transparent and comprehensive compensation disclosure, including rationale for non-standard metrics and year-over-year changes.

Candriam Investors Group,"**Candriam Investors Group Voting Policy on Remuneration**

- **General Approach:**  
  The ESG Policy closely evaluates compensation reports and policies, focusing on disclosure quality, pay-for-performance alignment, and peer comparisons. It recognizes ESG performance factors in assessing executive performance and supports linking compensation to environmental and social criteria.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:**  
  The ESG Policy will vote against compensation proposals if guaranteed bonuses are established or if egregious or excessive bonuses, equity awards, or severance payments have been granted. Excessive increases in fixed payments (e.g., over 10%) without adequate justification are also opposed.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:**  
  The policy supports performance-based equity compensation plans generally, especially for senior executives. It requires plans to include specific and appropriate performance goals, maximum award pools, and maximum award amounts per employee. The policy votes against plans that allow retesting of performance conditions. No numeric dilution limits or explicit rules on repricing/strike price are mentioned.

- **Performance Alignment:**  
  Compensation must be meaningfully linked to performance. The ESG Policy opposes excessive weighting of short-term performance measures (generally less than three years) in incentive plans and excessive management discretion to deviate from defined performance metrics. It generally supports performance-based equity plans for senior executives. The absence of clarity or disclosure on performance metrics leads to opposition.

- **Clawbacks:**  
  The absence of structural safeguards such as clawback and malus policies in incentive plans is a reason to vote against compensation proposals.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:**  
  The ESG Policy evaluates whether companies link compensation to environmental and social criteria and will vote against plans lacking such links in markets and sectors materially exposed to ESG risks. It supports shareholder proposals that include sustainability metrics in executive compensation.

- **Voting Considerations:**  
  - Significant disconnect between pay and performance  
  - Insufficient or inappropriate performance goals and metrics  
  - Lack of disclosure and clarity on compensation implementation

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** CEO pay is assessed against a proprietary framework considering market capitalisation and employee numbers, with multiples of national average household income generally ranging from 25x to 140x; excessive pay relative to these thresholds may lead to votes against remuneration proposals.  
- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** Dilution from share-based remuneration is generally limited to 10% of total issued capital over ten years; non-executive directors' share-based pay should not be performance-linked; holding and vesting periods, particularly in the UK, should total at least five years.  
- **Performance Alignment:** Performance criteria for remuneration must be clearly defined, challenging, aligned with strategic objectives, and avoid excessive risk-taking; inclusion of ESG performance metrics is encouraged with clear rationale; senior executives should hold a substantial shareholding requirement (e.g., FTSE100 CEOs 400% of base salary in shares within five years).  
- **Clawbacks:** Malus and clawback provisions should be included in executive remuneration packages with explicit reference to exercise circumstances.  
- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** Encouraged to include appropriate ESG measures in variable pay metrics with clear rationale.

- **General Approach:** Remuneration is paid for long-term financial performance and sustainable value creation, incorporating a broad stakeholder perspective. Non-financial motivators are given significant weighting.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** Variable remuneration is limited to a reasonable multiple of fixed remuneration per individual per annum. Variable incentive grants should be in ordinary listed shares only with a minimum period of 5 years. Variable pay that is non-performance based or with time-based elements exceeding 20% of total realized pay is not supported. Vesting periods less than 3 years are not accepted.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** Strong encouragement for inclusion of sustainability criteria with concrete, challenging targets (e.g., climate-related) in remuneration plans. Companies encouraged to include biodiversity, nature-related metrics, healthcare access metrics, and responsible tax metrics in executive remuneration when material.

Schroder Investment Management Ltd,"**Schroder Investment Management Ltd Voting Policy on Remuneration**

- **General Approach:** Executive remuneration should support long-term, sustainable business success and align with wider company remuneration policy; the remuneration committee is responsible for this alignment and must explain how remuneration promotes desired culture and mitigates unintended consequences.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** Base salaries should not constitute the majority of total pay; variable pay is expected to be performance-based and paid only when the company performs well; salary increases should be merit-based, in line with wider workforce, and phased over years; new executives should typically join at lower salaries than predecessors; threshold for short-term incentive awards should not exceed 50% of total possible award, preferably lower.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** LTIPs should constitute the bulk of executive pay, preferably in Performance Share Plans with at least a 3-year performance period and 2-year holding period; awards should be a percentage of salary; relative TSR should be a significant metric; alternative LTIPs require significant quantum reduction and minimum 5-year vesting; stock options should be used sparingly, not vest within 3 years, have performance conditions, and must never be repriced; no numeric dilution limits explicitly stated.

- **Performance Alignment:** LTIPs and short-term incentives should be linked to stringent, mostly financial performance metrics; ESG and strategic/personal metrics are encouraged only if clear, measurable, stretching, not too significant a portion, and backed by underpins or downward discretion; remuneration committees must explain these metric choices and associated risks; shareholding requirements expect CEO to hold 300% of salary and other executives 200%, with shares retained beyond employment.

- **Clawbacks:** Present; remuneration committees must have power and willingness to reduce pay on resignation encouraged by the board, unsatisfactory performance, or other reasons to ensure no payment for failure.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** Encouraged as part of variable pay if not at the expense of financial metrics; ESG metrics should be salient, measurable, and supported by underpins/downward discretion; inclusion of ESG metrics as an underpin is recommended.

  - Consideration of pay quantum relative to peers, performance conditions, and shareholding requirements.
  - Executive pay risk management and cultural alignment explanations by remuneration committee are expected.

Executive director notice or contract periods should generally not exceed two years. Pension contributions should be aligned with the general workforce. Discretionary payments outside formal schemes must be justified, valued, and disclosed.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** LTIPs should be equity-based, not cash. Material executive shareholding is required and should be held until retirement plus at least one year post-departure (UK and Ireland).

Share incentive schemes must not breach 10% total dilution over ten years; vote against proposals exceeding this.

- **Performance Alignment:** Performance targets must be stretching, clearly linked to economic value creation, and through-cycle, not tied to short-term share price. No rewards for median or worse performance or societal harm (e.g., accelerating climate change). No ‘retesting’ or retroactive repricing allowed. Disclosure of metrics and targets is required; absence leads to voting against. Complexity is discouraged; more than four metrics in LTIPs triggers a vote against policy.

- **Clawbacks:** Present. Vote against remuneration policies lacking adequate clawback provisions to reclaim compensation awarded erroneously or due to short-lived value destruction (e.g., excessive risk-taking).

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** Considered within performance alignment. Vote against remuneration policies that fail to incorporate environmental and social factors that prevent rewarding climate harm. Support adoption of ""net zero underpin"" safeguards.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** Not mentioned explicitly, but long-term variable remuneration should comprise a bigger share of total variable remuneration and be paid after four years at the earliest. Management should have an appropriate personal investment in shares amounting to at least one gross annual fixed remuneration to be reached within four years.

- **Performance Alignment:** Variable remuneration should integrate at least two different key figures for short- and long-term components, not solely share price-based. ESG targets should be materially significant, ambitious, quantitatively measurable, transparent, and verifiable, derived from the company’s sustainability strategy. Long-term targets should be based on a minimum three-year assessment period. Retrospective easing of performance measures is viewed critically.

- **Clawbacks:** Present. Remuneration can be reduced (malus) or reclaimed (clawback) in cases of gross breaches of duty, unethical behaviour, material breaches of care, or compliance and governance failures.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** ESG targets must be integrated quantitatively and transparently into long-term variable pay components and derived from the company's sustainability strategy.

- **Voting Considerations:**
  - Remuneration systems should be approved at the AGM at least every four years.
  - Remuneration reports must disclose detailed components, targets, pay-for-performance relationship, and changes relative to average workforce remuneration.
  - Remuneration committees must determine amount, type, scope, and entitlement criteria, and primarily consist of independent experts.

- **In summary:** Remuneration should be transparent, aligned with long-term sustainable value creation including ESG factors, capped reasonably, and subject to rigorous disclosure and investor approval."

VAN LANSCHOT KEMPEN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT N.V,"**VAN LANSCHOT KEMPEN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT N.V Voting Policy on Remuneration**

- **General Approach:** Remuneration policies should attract, retain, and motivate management, aligning their interests with stakeholders and ensuring shareholder return. Remuneration should be simple, transparent, reasonable in structure and quantum, and support long-term value creation.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** The variable component should not exceed 100% of base salary for financial issuers. Severance payments should not exceed one year’s salary. Transaction bonuses are not supported.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:**  
  - LTIPs should vest pro rata for departing directors based on tenure.  
  - LTIPs should have a minimum vesting period of at least 5 years for shares and 3 years for options (UK, Netherlands).  
  - Long-term incentives should include material sustainability/ESG metrics if they constitute at least 10% of the incentive and are tracked prior to inclusion.  
  - If tied to a peer group, composition and rationale must be disclosed.  
  - Holding period for awarded shares should be at least five years.  
  - Change of control provisions should align with market best practices.  
  - Discretionary authority to adjust variable and unvested remuneration downward should be allowed.  

- **Performance Alignment:** Performance metrics must be transparent, ambitious, quantifiable, measurable, stretching, time-bound, and directly linked to strategy and operational performance. Over-reliance on TSR or EPS is discouraged in favor of metrics like long-term revenue growth, EBITDA, sustainable value creation, and return on invested capital. Performance targets should be disclosed ex post where best practice. Absolute award limits must apply to all compensation components.

- **Clawbacks:** Schemes should include clawback and malus provisions allowing recovery or withholding of sums paid; absence of such provisions may lead to voting against. Clawback triggers are based on circumstances specified by the company.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** ESG/sustainability metrics are recommended to form at least 10% of LTIPs if tracked prior to inclusion. Remuneration should consider sustainability and long-term value creation. Shareholder proposals tying remuneration or LTIPs to environmental or social targets are supported.

- **Voting Considerations:**  
  - Support for remuneration committee composed solely of independent non-executive directors with a majority independent members.  
  - Oppose if remuneration policy lacks clarity, transparency, or fails to align pay with performance and sustainability strategy.  
  - Oppose if remuneration includes unreasonable pay ratios, inadequate performance linkage, excessive payments, or lacks periodic review.

- **In summary:** Remuneration policies must be reasonable, transparent, aligned with long-term performance and ESG criteria, with proper governance safeguards including clawbacks and independent oversight."

Voya Investment Management Co. LLC,"**Voya Investment Management Co. LLC Voting Policy on Remuneration**

- **General Approach:** Executive compensation programs should align with shareholder value, motivate and retain executives, minimize risks, and promote sustainability and corporate social responsibility.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** Compensation should not be excessive relative to peers; should have a reasonable percent of base pay relative to peers for both short- and long-term incentive plans; excessive non-performance-based pay elements and guaranteed multi-year awards are not allowed.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** LTIPs must have at least a three-year performance period; reloading and repricing of underwater options are problematic and to be avoided; double trigger cash and equity provisions should be included in severance for golden parachute payments.

- **Performance Alignment:** Compensation should incorporate challenging performance goals; align with mid- to long-term total shareholder return (TSR); use rigorous performance conditions; multi-year guaranteed awards are not acceptable.

- **Clawbacks:** Clawback provisions must exist in case of malfeasance or material accounting restatement.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** Executive compensation should provide proper incentives for sustainability and corporate social responsibility; shareholder proposals including environmental and social metrics in executive compensation will generally be supported if management does not provide credible reasons against.

- **Voting Considerations:**
  - Oppose boards if compensation programs contain problematic features such as excessive compensation, reloading/repricing underwater options, multi-year guaranteed awards without performance conditions, or problematic severance arrangements.
  - May withhold support of directors if the board is unresponsive to “Say on Pay” proposals that received low support or if no such proposal is on the agenda and problematic features exist.
  - Generally support ESG-related shareholder proposals if management cannot credibly justify opposition.

- **In summary:** Voya IM supports executive compensation programs that align with shareholder interests, incorporate rigorous performance metrics over multi-year periods, include clawback provisions, and promote sustainability, opposing programs with excessive or misaligned features."
Washington State Investment Board,"**Washington State Investment Board Voting Policy on Remuneration**

- **General Approach:** The WSIB votes proxies guided by fiduciary duty, aiming to advance long-term economic value through prudent and responsible corporate behavior. Executive compensation should be linked to business performance and be reasonable compared to peers.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** Supports plans that include maximum award pools and per-employee award limits; no explicit salary caps or bonus limits mentioned.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** Evaluates equity plans case-by-case; plans should be awarded only when needed, be approved every 3-4 years or less, limit annual dilution and voting power, and have costs proportional and reasonable to company performance and peers. Disfavors option repricing but may support if well justified for retention in competitive markets.

- **Performance Alignment:** Supports performance-based compensation with specific performance goals. Supports executive share ownership guidelines requiring building and holding meaningful shares over time. Supports equity award vesting tied to performance and pro-rata treatment upon change in control rather than full acceleration.

- **Clawbacks:** Present; WSIB considers recoupment of incentive compensation where fraud, misconduct, negligence, or policy breaches occur, especially if financial misstatements or reputational harm result. SEC-mandated clawback policies effective in 2024 are acknowledged.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** Not mentioned in remuneration sections.

- **Voting Considerations:**
  - Cost and reasonableness of compensation compared to company performance and peers.
  - Disclosure transparency including performance metrics and award limits.
  - Plans should not encourage excessive or automatic awards; shareholder approval is preferred for significant severance (golden parachute) agreements exceeding IRS guidelines (2.99x salary plus bonus).

- **In summary:** WSIB evaluates remuneration proposals to ensure executive pay is reasonable, linked to performance, transparent, and includes safeguards like clawbacks and controlled equity plan costs to protect long-term shareholder value."
Wellington Management,"**Wellington Management Voting Policy on Remuneration**

- **General Approach:** Executive compensation plans should attract and retain high-caliber executives, foster a culture of performance and accountability, and align management’s interests with long-term shareholders. Support for compensation plans is determined on a case-by-case basis considering their contribution to long-term value creation.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:** Not mentioned.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:** Evaluated case-by-case considering projected plan costs, plan features, and grant practices. Concerns include excessive dilution, repricing stock options/stock appreciation rights without shareholder approval, or automatic share replenishment (“evergreen” feature). Equity awards should be subject to performance and/or vesting periods of at least three years.

- **Performance Alignment:** Plans should align executive compensation with shareholder experience, showing strong positive correlation between pay and performance on absolute and relative bases over various timeframes. Executives should maintain meaningful equity ownership during and after employment. Performance-based compensation should be based on objective, rigorous metrics tied to shareholder value creation, with performance targets that are achievable but rigorous. Qualitative goals related to material ESG factors may be acceptable if applied fairly and consistently. Retesting provisions are viewed unfavorably barring extenuating circumstances.

- **Clawbacks:** Present. Companies should be able to recoup incentive compensation from management for fraudulent activities, accounting misstatements, or breaches of conduct causing reputational damage. Wellington supports shareholder proposals to establish robust clawback provisions and transparency around their application.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:** ESG factors may be included as qualitative goals if material to financial performance and if the compensation committee applies discretion fairly and consistently over time. DEI strategies are expected to be aligned with management incentives when appropriate.

- **Voting Considerations:**
  - Alignment of pay with long-term shareholder value.
  - Transparency of compensation committee decisions and benchmarking rationale.
  - Structure clarity favoring balanced cash vs. equity, fixed vs. variable, short vs. long-term pay, and discouragement of near-term focus through minimum three-year vesting.

- **In summary:** Wellington supports compensation plans that promote long-term value creation through pay-for-performance alignment, transparency, clarity, and accountability while opposing practices that dilute shareholder interests or misalign management incentives."
Zurcher Kantonalbank (Investment Management),"**Zurcher Kantonalbank (Investment Management) Voting Policy on Remuneration**

- **General Approach:**  
Assessment follows Sustainability Global Principles on Executive and Director Compensation, emphasizing clear disclosure, pay-for-performance alignment with long-term shareholder value, independent compensation committees, and avoiding inappropriate pay.

- **Salary Caps and Bonuses:**  
Termination payments must not exceed 24 months' pay or any more restrictive local legal provisions. Guaranteed or discretionary compensation is to be avoided.

- **Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and Stock Options:**  
Equity awards must not exceed 5% of issued share capital (up to 10% for high-growth or well-designed plans). Vesting must be at least three years from grant date with performance criteria disclosed if applicable. Awards must be granted at market price; discounts require mitigation via performance criteria or other features. Vote against stock option plans if potential share capital increase exceeds 5% (mature companies) or 10% (growth companies), or options are exercisable below market price. Repricing without shareholder approval within three years leads to adverse votes. Clawback provisions are required for equity awards. 

- **Performance Alignment:**  
Clear link between company performance and variable incentives required. Long-term incentives must have appropriate dilution, vesting, and performance conditions. Performance conditions must be measurable, quantifiable, fully disclosed, and long-term oriented (at least three consecutive years). Short-term variable compensation should not be disproportionately emphasized. Derogation policies, if applicable, must clearly define and limit elements and extent of discretion.

- **Clawbacks:**  
Present. Clawback provisions applicable to equity awards are expected.

- **ESG-Based Remuneration:**  
Financial and non-financial conditions, including ESG criteria, are relevant performance measures if they reward effective performance aligned with company purpose and strategy. Compensation committees should disclose how ESG matters influence remuneration outcomes.

- **Voting Considerations:**  
  - Clarity and comprehensiveness of compensation disclosures.  
  - Independent, effective compensation committee composition with no executives serving.  
  - Avoidance of egregious remuneration practices and significant pay-for-failure risks; adverse votes recommended if pay is excessive compared to peers or linked poorly to performance.

- **In summary:**  
Voting on remuneration focuses on transparency, alignment with long-term shareholder value including ESG factors, strong performance linkage, and prudent governance structures."
